### install library
As the creator of the website
I want to be able to import the library in both the back-end and the front-end
So that I can use it

### ACs
Given I have a static website
When I add an import on html of the front-end library like
    `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.github.com/static-website-search/deployed/static-website-search.js"></script>`
Then I have access to all the front-end functionalities the library offers

Given my static website is generated by a script
When I install the library with `npm install static-website-search`
Then I can start using the library
