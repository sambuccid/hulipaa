## Search bar
As the creator of the website  
I want to be able to place the searchbar in my website  
So that the user can see it

### AC1 [**done**]
In order to use the searchbar I should add a html tag like  
`<div class="hulipaa_searchbar" />`

### AC2 [**done**]
Given I added a searchbar successfully  
When I open the page  
Then the searchbar should be visible  
And it should be where I placed it

### AC3 [**done**]
The searchbar should have a textbox where to enter text  
The searchbar should have a button at the right of the textbox  
The search button should have a search icon

### AC4 [**done**]
Given I added some text in the textbox  
When I click the search button  
Then placed under the textbox there should be a section for the results  
And a message of successfull execution should be displayed
- used temporarily as placeholder for real search results

### AC5 [**done**]
Given I added some text in the textbox  
And I still have the html focus on the textbox  
When I press enter  
Then placed under the textbox there should be a section for the results  
And a message of successfull execution should be displayed
- used temporarily as placeholder for real search results
