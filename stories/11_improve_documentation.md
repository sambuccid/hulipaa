## Improve Documentation
As the creator of the website
I want to have clear instruction about the library
So that I can decide if to use it, and know how to use it

### AC1
Fix formatting in all makrdowns
- by adding to emtpy spaces at the end of the line to force a linebreak

### AC2
Create troubleshooting page in documentation
Where we can explain what to do in case of
- Issues setting up the library
- The errors shown in the search results
  - Most of them can indicate a set up issue
- Add link of the troubleshooting page in the tutorial
  - There is a TODO left there

### AC3
Create a new repo that will host a demo website
And add links and snapshots to all documentation pages
- Eventually the website will need to use the new style of the library
- The demo will need to contain thousands of pages, to show the strenghts of this library
- Add screenshot to "Open website" section of the tutorial

### AC4
Add link in tutorial for raising an issue on Github
- There is a TODO left there for it
