## Improve Documentation
As the creator of the website  
I want to have clear instruction about the library  
So that I can decide if to use it, and know how to use it

### AC1 [**in progress**]
Fix formatting in all makrdowns
- We need to check how they look in github

### AC2
Update the UI Tests documentation file with the new style of the search results

### AC3
Create troubleshooting page in documentation.  
Where we can explain what to do in case of
- Issues setting up the library
- The errors shown in the search results
  - Most of them can indicate a set up issue
- Add link of the troubleshooting page in the tutorial
  - There is a TODO left there

### AC4
Create a new repo that will host a demo website.  
And add links and snapshots to all documentation pages.
- Eventually the website will need to use the new style of the library
- The demo will need to contain thousands of pages, to show the strenghts of this library
- Add screenshot to "Open website" section of the tutorial

### AC5
Write new Readme with more informations about the library

### AC6
Add link in tutorial for raising an issue on Github
- There is a TODO left there for it

### AC7
Update Readmes in sub-folders with new description
