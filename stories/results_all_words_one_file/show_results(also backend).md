## Show all results of one page
As a visitor of the website
I want to be able to see the results of my search
So that i can use them

### AC1
Investigate if it's possible to have end-to-end tests that cover both generation of results and search of them

### AC2
Given there is a page with a long word first and then a shorter word that is a sub-part of the longer word(... them ... the ...)
And I have searched for the smaller word(the)
When I click on a result of a page
I want to see highlighted the smaller word

### AC3
The search should be case insensitive
- the results get generated all lower case
- the search transforms letters to lower case before searching
