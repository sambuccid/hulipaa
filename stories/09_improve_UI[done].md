## Improve UI
As a visitor of the website  
I want the UI to be simple but nice

### AC1 [**done**]
Load each result already prepopulated

### AC2 [**done**]
Remove the background and the border.  
There should be the title at the top and under it the result

### AC3 [**done**]
Adapt how "No Results" and "Error" messages are shown

### AC4 [**done**]
Change how to show the content of a result, to show a consecutive part of the page
- show a bit more amount text than what it is now
- remove the ... at the start and end of the shown content

### AC5 [**done**]
Change the font size for the title and the content, probably is the content that should be a bit smaller.  
Also put the title in a header element, but it shouldn't be a too big font
- It seems that using a header element might create issues as it adds a lot of decorations on the text

### AC6 [**done**]
Remove any code related to expanding the results.  
This also means making sure the result text is selectable with the mouse

### AC7 [**done**]
Check if might be worth having some different colors for the text.  
Usually the title is blue but, we can try different things.
- I think color is too much dependent on the background of the page, so keeping it black is better

### AC8 [**done**]
Try different fonts for the title of the page and the result content

### AC9 [**done**]
Redesign the size and font of "No Results" and "Error" messages

### AC10 [**done**]
Change the color of the highlight to make it less strong on the eye
- it was been removed completely in previous ACs

### AC11 [**done**]
Redesign the background and text color of the "No Results" and "Error" messages
- I think it's more accessible, clean and customisable to keep it black text over white background, as it is now

### AC12 [**done**]
Investigate adding different style for opening the search page on the mobile 
- maybe just background and shadow to make each result look like a card
- the card effect for error messages doesn't look good
- but it would require a big refactor to be able to avoid it

### AC13 [**done**]
Add back the underline on the title when the mouse hovers
- many search engines do that and it's definitively clearer that the element is clickable

### AC14 [**done**]
Find a better way of showing the single result errors  
*(eg. the errors on parse page and loading result)*
- Decided that to indicate to the website creator what to do, we'll have a section on the readme about it
