## Install library
As the creator of the website  
I want to be able to import the library in both the back-end and the front-end  
So that I can use it

### AC1 [**done**]
Given I have a static website  
When I add an import on html of the front-end library like
```
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hulipaa-ui@0.1.1"></script>
```
And I have a div with class `hulipaa_searchbar` in the page  
And I initialise the library executing the `Hulipaa` function  
Then I have access to all the front-end functionalities the library offers

### AC2 [**done**]
Given my static website is generated by a script  
When I install the library with `npm install hulipaa`  
Then I can start using the library

### AC3 [**done**]
Given I have installed the library  
When I try to import the module in my code  
Then both CommonJS sytnax and ESM syntax is supported

### AC4 [**done**]
Given I have installed the library  
When I run the library's function  
Passing the input folder that contains the files  
And the output folder where the search results will be saved  
And a function that will parse the input files  
And a function that will specify the url of the pages   
Then the results will be generated

### AC5 [**done**]
Update/create some documentation on how to use the library

### AC6 [**done**]
We need to update the css selectors, all of them need to be always finding elements inside the main search element.  
Mostly if the user uses some css classes in their page that will have the same name of some of the internal classesq we use, we shouldn't apply any css to the elements
