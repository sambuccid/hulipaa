## Improve UI
As a visitor of the website
I want the UI to be simple but nice

### AC1[done]
Load each result already prepopulated
- The code attached to expanding the results can be kept, there is an AC to clean it up

### AC2
Remove the backround and the border, there should be the title at the top and under it the result

### AC3
Change how to show the content of a result, to show a consecutive part of the page
- and maybe a bit more amount text than what it is now

### AC4
Change the font size for the title and the content, probably is the content that should be a bit smaller
Also put the title in a header element, but it shouldn't be a too big font

### AC5
Check if might be worth having some different colors for the text
Uaually the title is blue but we can try different things

### AC6
Try different fonts for the title of the page and the result content

### AC7
Change the color of the highlight to make it less strong on the eye

### AC8
Do we need some different style for the mobile?
- maybe just background and shadow to make each result look like a card)

### AC9
Remove any code related to expanding the results
- As part of that remove all references to `expandDiv` and instead use `resultContentDiv`
