# Hulipaa - Open Source Search for Static Websites

Hulipaa is a simple search engine designed to be used in a static website.

Hulipaa is light but scalable, it can index thousands of pages with no impact to the browser.

The search engine generates and indexes all the results when the website is built, using the same strategy of websites generators.  
This means you don't need a back-end server running.

## Demo
You can see the library in action in our [Demo Website](https://sambuccid.github.io/hulipaa-demo/).

In the demo we use Hulipaa to index and search on 3000 pages, for a total of over 215000 words.

You can also find the code of the Demo in the [Repository](https://github.com/sambuccid/hulipaa-demo).
