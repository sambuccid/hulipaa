# Hulipaa - Open Source Search for Static Websites

Hulipaa is a simple search engine designed to be used in a static website.

Hulipaa is light but scalable, it can index tens of thousands of pages with no impact to the browser.

The search engine generates and indexes all the results when the website is built, using the same strategy of websites generators.  
This means you don't need a back-end server running.
