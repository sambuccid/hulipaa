# Hulipaa - Open Source Search for Static Websites

Hulipaa is a simple search engine designed to be used in a static website.

The search engine generates and indexes all the results when the website is built, using the same strategy of websites generators, this means you don't need a back-end server running.

## Demo
You can see the library in action in our [Demo Website](https://sambuccid.github.io/hulipaa-demo/).

In the demo we use Hulipaa to index and search on 3000 pages, for a total of over 215000 words.

You can also find the code of the Demo in the [Repository](https://github.com/sambuccid/hulipaa-demo).
